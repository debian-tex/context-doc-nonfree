README for context-doc-nonfree
==============================

These pdfs have been downloaded from the webside of pragma-ade.com
and provide a huge amount of documentation for ConTeXt.

If you have acroread installed you can start an interactive tour
by opening 
	/usr/share/texmf/doc/context/base/showcase.pdf

Accessibility is also given via texdoc.
